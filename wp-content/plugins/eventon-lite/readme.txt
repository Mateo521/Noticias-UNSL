You can buy the EventON Full version from [codecanyon](http://codecanyon.net/item/ajde-event-calendar-wp-plugin/1211017?ref=ashanjay). After that uninstall the lite version and install the Full version on your website. If you want to move the data from lite version to Full version, make sure that you enable the "Do not delete eventon settings & data when EventON is uninstalled" option Settings -> General and "Save Changes" before uninstalling the lite version.

= How can I insert calendar on any page? = 

You can use the EventON shortcode generator that is available on any page in the classic editor tool panel or EventON gutenberg block. Simply access the generator, choose your desired settings, and the shortcode will be generated for you. You can then copy and paste the generated shortcode into the desired page where you want the calendar to be displayed. With the EventON shortcode generator, it becomes effortless to customize and incorporate EventON features into your pages.

= How do I filter events on load? = 
You can filter events on load using event type taxonomies using the eventON shortcode. Example [add_eventon event_type='23'] -- Please follow [the guide here](https://docs.myeventon.com/documentations/confused-event-type-categories/) for a detailed information.

= Should I purchase a EventON Full version? =
